# Reversi-Windows
The Reversi Game shown on my website at namankhurana.org

Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. It was invented in 1883. Othello, a variant with a change to the board's initial setup, was patented in 1971. Read the rules of Reversi at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi">Wikipedia.
